Nowadays, people from all over the world use social media platforms to share information. Twitter, for example is a platform in which users send, read posts known as ‘tweets’ 
and interact with different communities. Users share their daily lives, post their opinions on everything such as brands and places. Companies can benefit from this massive 
platform by collecting data related to opinions on them. The aim of this work is to present an approach that can perform sentiment analysis of real data collected from Twitter.

sentiment whether it is a positive, negative or neutral.
